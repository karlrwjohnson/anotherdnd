          <li><b>Good</b> characters generally desire to help people and want to make the world become a better place for everyone.</li>
          <li><b>Evil</b> characters are primarily driven by self-interest and do not care who they hurt while achieving their goals.</li>

          <li><b>Neutral</b> characters take a pragmatic approach, believing that laws are \"guidelines\" that uphold the peace most of the time,
          but some situations call for them to be broken.</li>
